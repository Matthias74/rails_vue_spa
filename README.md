## Rails 7 boilerplate with Vite and Vue.js

This project is a boilerplate to use rails and Vue.js with Vite.
It allows to create SPA as there is a Vue-router.
Bootsrap is also here.

NB: Vite is not working with all the node versions so a `.nvmrc` file should be added at the root
to specify the node version (here: v16.13.0)

Steps:
- bundle install
- yarn install

Server: `foreman start -f Procfile.dev`
